# Final Project Presentation

## Overview

Present your findings to your classmates.

## Deliverables

Present your project in a way that would make it compelling to a business stakeholder.

Your presentation should include...
   - A problem statement
   - Metrics and assumptions
   - Approach and process
   - Your model or solution
   - Performance evaluation (ideally expressed in terms of business outcomes)
   - High-level insights from your model (e.g. what are the most important features?)
   - Impact of your findings
   - Recommendations or next steps

Be prepared to explain and defend your model to an inquisitive audience. It is OK for this presentation to include some technical content that your peers will understand, such as MSE values, but I would like you to focus on the information that a business stakeholder would want -- in layman's terms, what does the model do and how well does it do it?

You will have something like 5-10 minutes to present, depending on how many students submit a final project. Exact timing guidelines for your cohort will be posted below a couple weeks ahead of time.

**DATR-524:** Aim for 6-8 minutes, with a hard cutoff at 10 minutes.

Submit any supporting materials for your project, such as slides or a Jupyter notebook, following the instructions in the Course Info doc. If you are submitting something other than a Jupyter notebook or other plain-text file, such as a Powerpoint file, convert it to PDF if possible.

## Tips

Put the bottom line up front (e.g. a description of the value that your model can provide and a brief statement of any important insights you gained along the way), and then back it up with supporting information.

Use slides and/or a Jupyter notebook as a visual aid. Include lots of visuals, and keep text short.

## Stretch Challenges

For a stretch challenge, you might create an interactive demo of your model in action, explain how you would deploy your model in a production environment, or discuss how to evaluate your solution's performance over time.

## Examples

You can see an example of a past presentation [here](./presentation_example.pdf) and additional examples at the [GA Gallery](https://gallery.generalassemb.ly/DS?metro=), but note that the GA Gallery examples in particular may have been based on somewhat different instructions.
